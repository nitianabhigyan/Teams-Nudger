# Teams-Nudger
A python code to keep Microsoft Teams nudged. This is not the most elegant solution out there, but it works.

## How to use
1. Download/Copy the script to your local machine and make sure you have python3 installed.
2. Open Microsoft teams in your windows machine.
3. Run the script using python3: <br>
  <code>python teams_nudger.py</code>
4. Resize the window to a cornder BUT IN FOREGROUND (i.e. the topmost window).
## TBD/Known Issues: 
1. Find a more elegant solution, overall.
2. This still causes a python window to be popped up in FOREGROUND to be effective.
3. Get the top left and bottom right max possiblities dynamically.
